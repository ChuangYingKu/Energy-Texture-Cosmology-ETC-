# Energy Texture Cosmology (ETC)

**v1.0 - Complete Theory**  
Author: Ying-Ku Chuang  
Released: December 20, 2025

A zero-parameter cosmological theory that eliminates spacetime curvature, dark matter, dark energy, inflation, event horizons, and Hawking radiation.

All observed phenomena are derived from three axioms using energy fibers as the sole entity.

- [13-A.pdf](13-A.pdf) – Full 13-chapter framework and verification roadmap
- [Appendix A.pdf](Appendix A.pdf) – Permanently locked parameters (locked 27 Nov 2025, any modification constitutes forgery)

## Key Locked Predictions (2026–2029)
- ngEHT: sharp black hole surface at 1.0091 ± 0.0012 R_s with 8–14 radial bright fibers
- Einstein Telescope: hard-surface echo in binary merger waveforms
- Permanent null result for Hawking radiation
- Dark matter searches forever negative
